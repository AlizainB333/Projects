## 📂 Featured Project Repositories

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **[FPGA](./FPGA)** | 🔺 *Fighter Jet Game on FPGA* using SystemVerilog with VGA output, GPIO inputs, and UART communication. Demonstrates RTL design, real-time control, and hardware/software integration. |
| **[Pantry_Pal](./Pantry_Pal)** | 🧠 Smart pantry manager with features such as recipe generator, reviews, and custom fridge built with *Flask*, *Python*, *JavaScript*, *SQL*, and *Google Cloud Platform*. Includes real-time inventory updates, expiry alerts, and recipe suggestions. |
| **[Embedded_Systems](./Embedded_Systems)** | 🧵 Projects involving locks, threads, and embedded C. Developed a **custom kernel** with low-level threading, interrupt-driven I/O, and scheduler logic for resource-constrained hardware. |
| **[C++_DSA](./C++_DSA)** | 🧩 Practice archive in C++ for common DSA topics — arrays, trees, graphs, dynamic programming — used in interviews and competitive programming. |
| **[AI](./AI)** | 🧠 ML experiments on *Transformers*, *Bayes Theorem*, and chess AI. Includes model notebooks and logic-based decision trees for game scenarios and probabilistic classification. |
| **[Computer_Architecture](./Computer_Architecture)** | 🔧 Designed and implemented the **ERR Processor** — a custom multi-stage pipelined processor built from scratch using Logisim. Includes hazard resolution, forwarding logic, and memory hierarchies. |
| **[Parralel_Programming](./Parralel_Programming)** | ⚡ GPU programming with CUDA/OpenMP for matrix multiplications and simulations. Focused on optimizing memory access patterns and thread utilization. |
| **[Mongo_Tutorial](./Mongo_Tutorial)** | 📊 MongoDB walkthrough covering schema design, aggregation framework, and CRUD operations in a backend app context. |
| **[Dashboards/Dash_1](./Dashboards/Dash_1)** | 📈 Developed custom web dashboards using *HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript*, and *Bootstrap* for live visualization of system metrics and application telemetry. |
| **[React App/reactapp](./React%20App/reactapp)** | ⚛️ Scalable React frontend template including reusable components, routing, and state management via hooks and context. |
| **[Twitter_Clone](./Twitter_Clone/twitter_clone)** | 🐦 Twitter clone built using Node.js and React. Features include real-time post updates, follow/unfollow functionality, and user feed rendering. |
| **[Social_Media_Page/server](./Social_Media_Page/server)** | 🌐 Backend API built with Express and MongoDB for a social media platform. Supports user authentication, CRUD operations, and secure session management. |
