## Project Summary

Pantry Pal will act as a one stop shop for all food-related needs and aims to make planning meals easier and less time-consuming. It will allow users to input the ingredients they already have at home, food preferences, allergies and calorie information to make personalized suggestions and plans. The functionalities include finding recipes that the user can make using only ingredients they already have, making personalized grocery lists based on liked recipes, retrieving a random recipe for the user to try, recommend recipes based on popularity and ranking, and creating meal plans based on calorie intake goals.
